Project Plan

Title: 
Lorenzo Llamas
FinesseFilm Productions
NYU School of Engineering
Fall 2015

Project Statement:
FinesseFilm Productions revolves around the realm of basketball and video editing, and has a collection of hundreds of subscribers. This website should gather each element from FFP and divide it into sections for videos, playlists, and general information for the company. The site should promote growth for the YouTube channel and create a greater following for the produced videos of FinesseFilm Productions, and at some point in the future expand towards new genres of video editing, and maybe even merchandise. 

Motivation:
I want a web foundation for my YouTube channel in order to collect more viewers, and followers/subscribers. People may feel more inclined to view the YouTube videos if they see the credible website, or vice versa if the website has extra content. Also, in the process of attempting to bring in more viewers I could adjust my videos and content to what more followers want and be able to better suit the needs of subscribers.

Target Audience:
Basketball fans, sport fans. Demographic for YouTube videos for basketball is maybe ages 14-24.
